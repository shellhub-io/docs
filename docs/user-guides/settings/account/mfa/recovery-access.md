# Recovering access

:::note
If you’re using the enterprise edition, you won’t be able to recover access by
yourself with a recovery email. In that case, you need to contact the
administrator of the server instance.
:::

If you lose access to your TOTP app and all recovery codes, you can regain
access to your account using your [recovery email](../recovery-email).

1. **Log In to ShellHub**: Access your ShellHub account using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Settings Page**: Click on your profile icon and select
   “Settings.”

3. **Disable MFA**: In the “Multi-Factor Authentication” section, click the
   “Disable MFA” button.

4. **Click on “CLICK HERE”**: Once you can provide a TOTP code, click on “CLICK
   HERE”.

5. **Click on “CLICK HERE” (again)**: Once you can provide a recovery code,
   click on “CLICK HERE.” After clicking the button, two emails will be
   sent—one to your primary email and another to your recovery email. Each
   email contains an unique code. You must provide both codes on the page where
   the email button redirects you. Both emails will redirect to the same page.

6. **Enter Your Codes**: Enter the codes sent to both your primary and recovery
   emails and then click on the "DISABLE MFA" button. You’ll be redirected to
   your dashboard in a few seconds.
