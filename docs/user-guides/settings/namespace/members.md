# Members management

You can add multiple members to your namespace to allow your users
to manage your device fleet as a team.

To view namespace members open the namespace settings by clicking
in **Settings** on the sidebar and **Namespace** tab on the page.

## Roles

A role defines the set of privileges assigned to a member.
Each member must be assigned a role that determines which
actions that user can perform on the namespace.

The following roles can be applied to members:

* **Administrator**: Administrators have full access to the namespace.
Can perform almost all actions what owner can do, except add new
administrator or remove an existing one and cannot access billing information.

* **Operator**: Operators may perform basic operation on devices.

* **Observer**: Observer may only connect and see details about a device and its session.

## Adding members

When a namespace needs to be shared with more than one user,
the namespace owner or administrators can add new members.

To add a namespace member, from the namespace settings page
click in **Add Member** button, fill the form and click in
**Add** button.
