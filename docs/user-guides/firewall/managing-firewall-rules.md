# Managing Firewall Rules

ShellHub provides flexible firewall for filtering SSH connections.
It gives a fine-grained control over which SSH connections reach the devices.

Using Firewall Rules you can deny or allow SSH connections
from specific IP address to a specific or a group of devices
using a given username.

This feature is only available in [ShellHub Cloud](https://shellhub.io)
and ShellHub Enterprise.
