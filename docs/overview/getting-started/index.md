# Getting Started

If you want to get started with ShellHub as quickly as possible,
the ShellHub Cloud is the way to go. With the ShellHub Cloud,
you don't need to worry about provisioning a server or setting up any infrastructure.

If you prefer to self-host ShellHub, you can follow the documentation
to set up the Community Edition on your own server.
