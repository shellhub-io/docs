# Introduction

Welcome to the Self-Hosted section of the ShellHub documentation! Here, you will
find everything you need to know about installing and running ShellHub on your
own infrastructure. Hosting on your own servers gives you complete control over
your deployment, allowing you to customize and scale according to your needs.
This can be particularly important for organizations with strict security or
compliance requirements.

## Editions Available for Self-Hosting

## Community Edition

The **Community Edition** is open-source and includes the core features of ShellHub.
It is perfect for individual developers, small teams, or organizations that do
not require the advanced features of the **Enterprise Edition**.
The Community Edition allows you to:

- Manage unlimited devices.
- Use a web-based interface for device management.
- Access basic monitoring and logging.
- Utilize community support and resources.

## Enterprise Edition
